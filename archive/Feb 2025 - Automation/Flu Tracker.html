<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pulling-cdc-data-via-api">Pulling CDC Data via API</h2>
<p>The CDC has a <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/browse">wonderful data repository</a> with many oft-updated sources, including for infectious disease. To pull the data through their application programming interface (API), you do need to set up an account, but the process is quite painless and within minutes you can begin pulling your data using an R package called <code>RSocrata</code>. Their documentation of this process is well organized. For example, we will begin by examining overall <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/kvib-3txy">lab-confirmed flu weekly hospitalization rates</a>.</p>
